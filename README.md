This is a website for my former high school's crochet club. The site provides information about the club, videos about how to complete certain crochet techniques (eventually!), and a biography and 
contact information for the club's current executives. Photographs of crochet work can also be found on each page. This website was built using the React programming language in order to better 
understand the language's capabilities. The website will continue to be updated over the course of the year.
