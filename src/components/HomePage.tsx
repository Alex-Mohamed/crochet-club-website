        Welcome to the Long Reach High School Crochet Club! This after-school
        club is a place for students <br />
        to relax and develop a passion for the art of crochet. As a member, you
        can use this time to make new <br />
        friends and learn various crochet techniques at weekly meetings.
        <br />
        <br />
        This website contains all of the information you need to participate in
        this club! In addition to weekly <br />
        meetings, videos will be posted under the "Videos" tab for this website
        with tutorials involving different <br />
        crochet techniques. Use these resources to hone your craft outside of
        meeting times! <br />
        <br />
        You can also click on the "Executives" tab to learn more about the
        club's current executives in place.
        <br />
        Contact information will also be available regarding any questions and
        concerns.
